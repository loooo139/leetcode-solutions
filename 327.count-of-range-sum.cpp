 * Testcase Example:  '[-2,5,-1]\n-2\n2'
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in
 * [lower, upper] inclusive.
 * Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between
 * indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.
 * 
 * Note:
 * A naive algorithm of O(n^2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
 * Output: 3 
 * Explanation: The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and their respective
 * sums are: -2, -1, 2.
